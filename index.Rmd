## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to the grade distribution of students, particularly white males, when David Kane taught this class versus when the visiting professors taught it in 2021.  I realize this might be infeasible because I would need access to data from Harvard that they would likely be very reluctant to release to a student because the potential findings would cast a negative light on the university and their hiring policies.  I think this would be a very interesting project because this class has always had the skeleton in the closet because of David Kane and his blogs relating to race and women and it would be very enlightening to see data that exposes whether or not his biases had an effect on the distribution of grades in the class.
